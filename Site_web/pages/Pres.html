                        <h2>Purpose of the project</h2>
                    <p>Read the colors is a project realized by Maxime DUCOIN within the framework of his engineering school course and more particularly of the minor "Métiers de la création numérique".<br />
                    Within the framework of this minor, the students were asked to realize, individually or in groups, a project mixing technologies, and more precisely digital domain, with an artistic dimension.</p>
                    <br />

                        <h2>Starting idea</h2>
                    <p>The main idea of the project is to provide several tools to color code a text, I.e. to replace each letter by the color that has been assigned to it and then be able to visualize this text in an innovative way.</p>
                    <br />

                        <h2>Realization</h2>
                    <p>Then this initial idea had to be developed to add more technicality to the project.<br />
                    Indeed, the following points have been added:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Creation of a website</p></li>
                        <li><p>Addition of an interactive part</p></li>
                        <li><p>Addition of several color palettes</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
    
                        <h3 id="Création d'un site web">Creation of a website</h3>
                    <p>A website seems to be the best tool to realize this project, indeed, it is easy to use, accessible to all and requires no download.</p>
    
                        <h3 id="Ajout d'une partie interactive">Addition of an interactive part</h3>
                    <p>Add a more playful aspect in order to extend the attractiveness of this project is necessary, indeed, the basic idea is purely artistic because it makes it possible to visualize a text in color and to give a new dimension to the writings but to make it possible to the people to discover or to learn to read the colors is also interesting.<br />
                        This new idea would allow users to discover the letters composing the text as they go along. By first seeing the numerical work drawn from the text to then reveal the letters one by one with their cursor.</p>

                        <h3 id="Ajout de plusieurs palettes de couleurs">Addition of several color palettes</h3>
                    <p>In the development of the subject it also seemed necessary to offer the possibility of using different color palettes so that the theme of the digital work is as close as possible to the theme of the text.</p>
